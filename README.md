# Getting Started with Create React App

Similar to a Netlify Dashboard, this productivity app emersises the user in a calming environment that allows them to focus on their tasks. 
Various amounts of data are displayed such as: Today's date/time, a countdown for the year and week, a weather search, and a task manager. This 
complex project was my most time consuming as used Axios to call API's for the weather, used JavaScript to display the time as well as allowed the user to
add or subtract tasks, and used Firebase as a backend to cache the tasks created.

## Libraries Used

ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Axios
